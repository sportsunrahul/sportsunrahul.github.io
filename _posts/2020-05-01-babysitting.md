This is one of the most essential part of training process. This needs one-time set up and has to be done almost always.

1. One Time Setup
  - Activation Functions
  - Data Preprocessing
  - Weight Initialization
  - Regularization
  - Gradient Checking

2. Training Dynamics
  - Babysitting the learning process
  - Parameter updates
  - Hyperparameter optimization
