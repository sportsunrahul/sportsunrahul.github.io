I am currently pursuing Master's in [Electrical and Computer Engineering Department](https://www.ece.ncsu.edu/) at [NC State University](https://www.ncsu.edu/). I am fascinated by the problem of improving computer vision models when we have limited annotated data. We can use transfer learning method called domain adaptation to train our model using datasets from different domains. Generalization can be improved if we can get rid of domain gap and make use of different domains' annotated datasets.
